### Are you looking for help?

This is an issue tracker, used to manage and track the development of Play JSON. It is not a support system and so it is not a place to ask questions or get help. If you're not sure if you have found a bug, the best place to start is with either the [users mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/play-framework) or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=play-json). If you have a feature request, the [developer mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/play-framework-dev) is a better forum than an issue tracker to discuss it.

If you want to discuss a feature request, the same tools are available.  

### Play JSON Version (2.5.x / etc)



### API (Scala / Java / Neither / Both)



### Operating System (Ubuntu 15.10 / MacOS 10.10 / Windows 10)

Use `uname -a` if on Linux.

### JDK (Oracle 1.8.0_72, OpenJDK 1.8.x, Azul Zing)

Paste the output from `java -version` at the command line.

### Library Dependencies

If this is an issue that involves integration with another system, include the exact version and OS of the other system, including any intermediate drivers or APIs i.e. if you connect to a PostgreSQL database, include both the version / OS of PostgreSQL and the JDBC driver version used to connect to the database.

### Expected Behavior

### Actual Behavior

Please provide a description of what actually happens, working from the same starting point.

Be descriptive: "it doesn't work" does not describe what the behavior actually is -- instead, say "the page renders a 500 error code with no body content."  Copy and paste logs, and include any URLs.  Turn on internal Play JSON logging with `<logger name="play" value="TRACE"/>` if there is no log output.
